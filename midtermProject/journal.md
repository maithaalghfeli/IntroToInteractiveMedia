# Saber Strike

The game Saber Strike is a simplified implementation of the famous arcade app Knife Hit by the game developers known as Ketchapp.
In Knife Hit, a rotating log is centered high up in the screen. There are knifes situated underneath that will be thrown at the rotating log when the user gives input for that to happen. There is also a knife count on the side that changes with every level, and a score count.

Saber Strike however is a Star Wars themed entertainment game of reflexes and skills in which you flaunt your saber striking abilities! This game has incredible playability and holds a great deal of pleasure and fun! 

Saber Strike differs from Knife Hit in the theme and that it consists of one level only, and for the time being has no obstacles on the planet (I may add those later if time permits).

# Progress

**Thursday Feb 18, 2021**

Today's work was simple, I only researched how I was going to execute this project, I looked for other people's recreations of this app and saw how they went about recreating it. What their code looked like and what programs they used.

**Thursday Feb 22, 2021**

I took a break from working on the Project as other work got stressfull, but today I worked on the background, I am still scouting for sound, quite confused as to whether use a Star Wars soundtrack as a background or not (Most probably will). I also inserted the typeface I am going to be using it is called *Krungthep* which is quite on brand with the theme. I have the saber count ready, that took a long while to figure out. I used arrays to do it. I have played with the Saber and Planet positioning but have not executed any code on them yet.
