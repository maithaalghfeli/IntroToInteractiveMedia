# Saber Strike

The game Saber Strike is a simplified implementation of the famous arcade app Knife Hit by the game developers known as Ketchapp.
In Knife Hit, a rotating log is centered high up in the screen. There are knifes situated underneath that will be thrown at the rotating log when the user gives input for that to happen. There is also a knife count on the side that changes with every level, and a score count.

Saber Strike however is a Star Wars themed entertainment game of reflexes and skills in which you flaunt your saber striking abilities! This game has incredible playability and holds a great deal of pleasure and fun! 

Saber Strike differs from Knife Hit in the theme and that it consists of one level only, and for the time being has no obstacles on the planet (I may add those later if time permits).

###### SIDE NOTE: THIS IS JUST AN IMAGINATIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STAR WARS THEME AND IT DOES NOT, BY ANY CHANCE, REPRESENT A PROPER REPRESENTATION!
