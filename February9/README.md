### Inspiration:

Building on last week's cosmos idea, I wanted to continue incorporating space as an art form through code. Therefore I looked at ways by which to create shooting stars and play with what they produce. This project had a lot of trial and error and no specific end goal in mind giving me enough space to explore the code.

### Execution:

#### Difficulty
 - For the background work, I referenced an old project I had that layered light opacitiy rectangles with a little random star on top of each other at a high framerate giving it an illusion of a dynamic starry night. At first I kept using background and got quickly annoyed by the flashing effect the full opacity of the background caused, using `rect()` in the size of the board was a much better option given I can play with opacity.
 
 - The initial star formation was the most difficult to come up with. I referenced *Jeremy Rodrigo's* work for the rest of the project inspiration as it made it much easier to understand what I was working with.
 
 - Taking the time to dissect *Rodrigo's* work was quite a nuisance, it made me appreciate the Professor's specific requirement to comment our codes. I omitted many of his work to give myself room to play with a totally different topic. In *Jeremy's* work, he makes the star rotate around an X and Y position that I did not necessarily understand and had some sort of velocity change. He also had a very static shooting star trail while mine was more dynamic. 
 
 - I must admit, this code execution was the one of the most difficult I have ever done, most of the time I felt completely lost and had to reference the Processing reference page and other people's GitHub's to understand variations and ways of executing something specific.
 
#### Leading to the Final Product:
 - I preferred adding more Class elements into my code. I took *Jeremy's* star function and turned it into a class function in my code. With that I was able to produce the explosive element as the `mouseClicked()` happened. 
 
 - Adding the Star Class as an Array allowed me to have a better randomised explosion, that allowed for more dynamic elements in the project. 
 
 - I enjoyed pushing my limits and exxploring new concepts in this code.
